## Description

Pokemon have types and these types have strengths and weaknesses.
There's a lot of charts and tables for this, but I never found them presented the way I would like them to be. What I want is a **VERY SIMPLE** and **VERY BASIC** quick view.

Currently this only shows the types in the most basic way and to be honest, that's how I want them to be. Obviously we all know there's more to know about types stgrengths and weaknesses, but as I said, this is meant to be a quick look where no actual looking or thinking is needed, you just see what this type is strong against and what its weakness is.

2- Download this project
3- Go to the project's directory in your terminal
4- "npm i" in the terminal
5- Make a config.env file in the configuration folder. You can use the configSample.env file for help

# Code Documentation

In case anyone for some reason would like to use this code for any reason, I'll try and add some more documentation in each folder and of course a main description here. If you do like what you see, just tell me, i don't mind it. Here's my twitter if you ever want to chat [@Mumbzi\_](https://twitter.com/Mumbzi_)

Currently I'm using ExpressJS with express-handlebars as a view engine. The database is Mongo, but obviously I use mongoose alongside it.
