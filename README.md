# Main
## Description
Pokemon have types and these types have strengths and weaknesses.
There's a lot of charts and tables for this, but I never found them presented the way I would like them to be. What I want is a **VERY SIMPLE** and **VERY BASIC** quick view.

Currently this only shows the types in the most basic way and to be honest, that's how I want them to be. Obviously we all know there's more to know about types stgrengths and weaknesses, but as I said, this is meant to be a quick look where no actual looking or thinking is needed, you just see what this type is strong against and what its weakness is.

## Info source
- [PokemonDB](https://pokemondb.net/type)

## Future plans
- An actual interface
- Icons

# Running the project
So ideally, non developers won't use this, but I'll include an easy explanation and a more advanced one (later on).
## The easiest way
### Prerequisites
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### What to do
1. Download the project by pressing on the "Code" in the project's main page
2. Download as a zip file
3. On your PC, go to "Documents"
4. Create a folder called EXACTLY "GitHub" without the " " of course.
5. Create a folder called "Pokemon"
6. Extract the files there
7. In the project, there's a ".ps1" file, just run it USING POWERSHELL or a terminal, I don't think command prompt will do the job, and I'm too lazy to test.
8. Now your project should be running


# Code Documentation
In case anyone for some reason would like to use this code for any reason, I'll try and add some more documentation in each folder and of course a main description here. If you do like what you see, just tell me, i don't mind it. Here's my twitter if you ever want to chat [@Mumbzi_](https://twitter.com/Mumbzi_)

Currently I'm using ExpressJS with express-handlebars as a view engine. The database is Mongo, but obviously I use mongoose alongside it.
